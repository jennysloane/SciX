# Hi Student,

## This assignment is for you to practice some coding before our course and is based on the RyouWithMe unit: BasicBasics 3. 

# In this assignment, you will be asked to read in some data and to look into its structure.
# To do this:

# 1. Please go to your files and see a dataset name: data_choiceAge_Group.csv 
# 2. save is as a new variable : MyFirstDataSet (e.g. ).

# 3. Show below that you can view the dataset and look at the dimensions/structure by:
# 3.1. Indicate how many observations are there in the data set?

# 3.2. Indicate how many variables?

# 3.3. What type is the column: IQ?

# 3.4. What is the name of the function that can show you the only the upper part of the dataset in the console (i.e. in case you just want to have a quick look at the first rows)?  


# 4. What is the Mean and Max IQ values in the dataset?
