# SciX 2019-2020

I had the pleasure to mentor 5 incredible high school students in a summer school program called SciX at the University of New South Wales in Jan 2020.

## Pre Summer School
Before the summer school began, I coded an experiment in javascript using jspsych. The experiment includes CRT items, the flanker task, and a random dot motion paradigm.
The experiment also included a few demographic questions, BIG5 personality inventory, the BIS (impulsivity scale), and a self-control scale.
You can find the final version of the experiment in the exp-js folder and it's called "index". <br><br>
I worked with the students online to help them develop unique hypotheses. 
I also created a few online assignments for the students to complete to better prepare them for the summer school <br>

## Summer School
During the summer school, we had a total of 9 research labs. Some of the labs were lectures, where I covered topics, including pre-registration, ethics, the different cognitive tasks in our experiment, and an intro to stats. 
The students even had a chance to complete and submit their own pre-registration form online.
Walking the students through each step, I put the experiment up on MTurk and we watched participants sign up and complete our experiment in real time. 
The students spent the majority of the research labs analyzing the results to their specific hypotheses. <br>

## Material
- The experiment is posted in the exp-js folder
- The powerpoints for the research labs are included
- We had ethics approval for this experiment (but those files are not included here)
