# SciX 
I had the pleasure to mentor high school students in a summer school program called SciX at the University of New South Wales for a few years during my PhD (2018-2021). I was part of SciX from the first year it was run at the university and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to be involved! 

The goal of the summemr school.... 

The first year, the summer school was in person, but because it was a new program the class sizes very small - I mentored 5 awesome high school students.

## Pre Summer School
Before the summer school began, I coded an experiment in javascript using jspsych. The experiment includes CRT items, the flanker task, and a random dot motion paradigm.
The experiment also included a few demographic questions, BIG5 personality inventory, the BIS (impulsivity scale), and a self-control scale.
You can find the final version of the experiment in the exp-js folder and it's called "index". <br><br>
I worked with the students online to help them develop unique hypotheses. 
I also created a few online assignments for the students to complete to better prepare them for the summer school. <br>

## Summer School
During the summer school, we had a total of 9 research labs. Some of the labs were lectures, where I covered topics, including pre-registration, ethics, the different cognitive tasks in our experiment, and an intro to stats. 
The students even had a chance to complete and submit their own pre-registration form online.
Walking the students through each step, I put the experiment up on MTurk and we watched participants sign up and complete our experiment in real time. 
The students spent the majority of the research labs analyzing the results to their specific hypotheses. <br>

## Materials 
- Pre summer school assignments
- The experiment is posted in the exp-js folder
- All questions and surverys are in the exps-js folder
- The powerpoints for the research labs 
- We had ethics approval (but those files are not included here)

# 2021 Folder
Because of Covid, we had to make several modification to our course including converting it to an online course. In this folder, you can find all of the pre-work and the PowerPoint slides. The experiment was fairly similar with a few additions, so I've uploaded the index.html file (the code for the actual experiment). However, all of the other files necessary to run the experiment are in the 2019 folder.
